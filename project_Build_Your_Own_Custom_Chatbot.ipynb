    "The dataset selected for this project is: NYC food scrap drop off sites. The csv file used contains locations, hours, and other information about food scrap drop-off sites in New York City. This information was retrieved in early 2023, and you can also get the latest version from here: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/if26-z6xq. This datasource contains very specific information about scrapes drop off sites that a user will request like location, type of food, opening and closing time. This data is very dynamic and can change very often.  An LLM is hard to follow these changes especially when the training data and time intervals are too big and costly. This way by just importing the new csv data in our RAG application we have our customized chatbot ready within minutes at a fraction of the cost of an LLM. \n"
